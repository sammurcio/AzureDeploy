>[AZURE.NOTE]This is preliminary documentation for Azure Recovery Services Analytics, a management solution you can deploy into OMS that will provide insights and analytics of your Recovery and Backup vaults. The solution is currently in preview. 

Azure Recovery Services Analytics will monitor your Recovery and Backup Vault in Azure (ARM) and visualize the data in Log Analytics. The data ingestion is currently based on Automation Runbooks that has to be deployed to a dedicated Automation Account.

## Pre-reqs

- **Automation Account with SPN**

Before you deploy this template, you must create an Automation Account in the Azure portal with the default settings so that the SPN account will be created. If you have an existing OMS Log Analytics Workspace you would like to use for this OMS ASR solution, it is important that the Automation account is created into the **same Resource Group where the OMS Log Analytics Workspace is located**.

If you **dont** have an existing OMS Log Analytics Workspace, the template will create and deploy this for you.

## Deploying the Azure Recovery Services Analytics Solution

### Follow these instructions to deploy the solution into an existing - or new Log Analytics Workspace

Log into Azure Portal (https://portal.azure.com) and ensure you are in the subscription containing the recovery vault you want to monitor

Locate your existing OMS Log Analytics Workspace and note the name of the workspace, the location of the workspace, and the Resource Group

Next, create a new Automation Account and click on *New* and search for 'Automation'

![alt text](images/knautomation.png "automation")
 
Select Automation and click *Create* 

Specify the name of the Automation Account and ensure you are selecting 'Use existing' and selects the Resource Group containing the OMS Log Analytics workspace. If possible, use the same Azure Region for the Automation Account. Ensure that 'Create Azure Run As account' is set to 'Yes' and click 'Create'

Once the deployment has completed, you should see the Automation account and the Log Analytics workspace in the same Resource Group

###You can now deploy the template

#### Parameters

* OMS Log Analytics Workspace Name

Specify the name of the workspace you want to deploy this solution to

* OMS Log Analytics Region

Select the Azure Region where your existing workspace is located

* OMS Automation Account Name

Specify the name of the automation account you created earlier

* OMS Automation Region

Select the Azure Region where your automation account is located

* OMS Recovery Vault Name

Type in the name of your recovery vault. Note that this parameter is case-sensitive and you must spell out the name correctly for the data collection to work

You should also change the values for the *Asr Ingest Schedule Guid* and *Ab Ingest Schedule Guid*. You can generate your own using PowerShell with the following cmdlet:

Once you have customized all the parameters, click *Create*

The ingestion will start 5-10 minutes post deployment.

## Exploring the views

Once the template has successfully been deployed, the first data ingestion should occur 6-8 minutes post deployment. If you are deploying the solution to a new workspace, it can take approximately 30 minutes before the indexing has completed for the workspace in general. 

In the Resource Group where you deployed the template, you should see two solution resources.

* AzureBackup[workspaceName]
* AzureSiteRecovery[workspaceName]

### Azure Backup

The views for Azure Backup will give you an overview of all the virtual machines within the region where your vault is deployed, and tell you whether they are protected or unprotected. 

The job view shows the last jobs and their state, so you can ensure that your backup operations are compliant.

### Azure Site Recovery

In the views for Azure Site Recovery, we are currently looking at all your protected VMs, and the supported scenarios in this release is:

* Hyper-V 2 Azure
* VMware/physical 2 Azure

We categorize the VMs based on the scenario(s) you have enabled and will give you a holistic view across all the events and jobs for the recovery vault

## Scale-out: Adding additional vaults

The solution is designed to support multiple Recovery & Backup vaults - also across subscriptions.
To add another Recovery & Backup vault to the solution, you simply have to deploy this template and provide the workspace Id and the workspace Key for the workspace where you already have deployed the solution.

## Pre-reqs

- **Automation Account with SPN**

Due to specific dependencies to modules, variables and more, the solution requires that you creates additional Automation accounts when scaling the solution to collect data from additional vaults. You must create an Automation Account in the Azure portal with the default settings so that the SPN account will be created.


- **OMS workspace Id and Key**

This template will have parameters that will ask for the workspace Id and the workspace Key, so that the runbooks are able to authenticate and ingest data.
You can log in to the OMS classic portal and navigate to Settings --> Connected Sources to find these values

Once you have completed the pre-reqs, you can click on the deploy button below

[![Deploy to Azure](http://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fkrnese%2Fazuredeploy%2Fmaster%2FOMS%2FMSOMS%2FSolutions%2Frecoveryservices%2FaddRecoveryServices.json) 

Once deployed you should start to see data from your additional vault flowing into your workspace, and you can query based on resourceId, subscriptionId, vault name, resource group and more.
